### Todo
   * extract movie metadata
   * convert .mov to .mp4 during thumbnail processor for reliable viewing
   * way to navigate up to folder selection (or keep the breadcrumbs menu visible at the top after you scroll down) 
   * theme for an album (background, border, roundings)
   * sorting is now global, make it by album 


### Changes
   * scrolling is instant instead of smooth
