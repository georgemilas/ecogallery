### Todo
   * extract movie metadata
   * convert .mov to .mp4 during thumbnail processor for reliable viewing
   * way to navigate up to folder selection (or keep the breadcrumbs menu visible at the top after you scroll down) 
   * theme for an album (background, border, roundings)
   * sorting is now global, make it by album 
   * pressing next with same image name -> use path or id instead of name? 
   * going back to album on large albums (wait for gallery to render before setting to last image - show loading?)
   * get rid of duplicates in search result like the same image in all these 3 folders album\select\best (image hash?)
   

### Changes
   * scrolling is instant instead of smooth
   * add the breadcrumbs to the image viewer
   * 108.250.182.25 / 192.168.1.254
